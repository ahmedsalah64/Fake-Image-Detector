Images are often manipulated with the intent and purpose of benefiting one party. In fact, images 
are often considered as evidence of a fact or reality, therefore, fake news or any form of 
publication that uses images that have been manipulated in such a way has greater capability and 
potential to mislead. To detect image forgeries, large amounts of image data are needed, and a 
model that can process every pixel in the image. Apart from that, efficiency and flexibility in 
training data are also needed to support its use in everyday life. The concept of big data and deep 
learning is the right solution to this problem. Therefore, with a Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN) architecture that utilizes Error Level Analysis (ELA), image forgery detection can reach 
91.83% and convergence in only 9 epochs.
